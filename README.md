Solutions to problem sets and code for https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/the-book.html

I do not guarantee correctness of the solutions presented here, although I always try to get the coding examples to match the graphs exactly as they are in the textbook. I note otherwise when I am unsure of a solution. Please contact me if you see any errors or would like to contribute to the solutions presented here as a learning resource for others.
